# Packlite: Technology Stack & Best Practices

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with Next.js
  - Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO
  - Built-in routing capabilities
  - API routes for backend functionality
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
  - React Query for server state
  - Context API for UI state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - Utility-first approach for consistent design
  - Easy responsive design
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js / Chart.js
  - For weight distribution visualizations
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
  - Performance and validation

### Backend

- **API**: Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
- **Database**: MongoDB
  - Schema flexibility for evolving data models
  - Atlas for managed cloud hosting
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
  - Social logins
  - JWT for session management
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
  - For gear images and user uploads

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Vercel
  - Seamless integration with Next.js
  - Global CDN
  - Easy preview deployments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Sentry
  - Error tracking
  - Performance monitoring

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** with Airbnb config for consistent code style
- **Prettier** for automatic formatting
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks

### Architecture

- **Component Structure**:
  - Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
  - Container/Presenter pattern for separation of concerns
- **Feature-based organization**:
  - Group files by feature rather than type
  - Shared components in a common directory

### API Design

- RESTful API conventions
- Consistent error handling
- Request validation with Zod
- API versioning strategy

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Cypress
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 70% coverage for critical paths
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core

### State Management

- Use React Query for server state
- Use Context API for shared UI state
- Use component state for local UI state
- Separate read/write concerns

### Performance Guidelines

- Lazy loading of images and routes
- Code splitting
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Pagination for large datasets

### Security Practices

- Input validation on all forms
- HTTPS only
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Regular dependency auditing

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Strategy**:
  - main (production)
  - develop (staging)
  - feature/\* (feature branches)
- **Pull Request Requirements**:
  - Code review by at least one team member
  - Pass all automated tests
  - Meet code coverage thresholds

### Documentation

- JSDoc comments for functions and components
- README files for each major directory
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Storybook for component documentation

## Development Environment

- VS Code as recommended editor
- Shared extensions and settings
- Docker for consistent development environments

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase
- Functions: camelCase
- Files: kebab-case
- CSS classes: BEM methodology

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular tech stack evaluations
- Performance budgets
- Accessibility audits
- User feedback integration process
